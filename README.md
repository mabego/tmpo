**tmpo** allows you to track time effortlessly with simple commands that live in your terminal. Track time with automatic project detection, organize work into milestones, view stats, and export data; all without leaving your workspace.

## About

**tmpo** is a lightweight, developer-friendly time tracking tool designed to integrate seamlessly with your terminal workflow. It automatically detects your project context from Git repositories or configuration files, making time tracking as simple as `tmpo start` and `tmpo stop`.

### Why tmpo?

- **🚀 Fast & Lightweight** - Built in Go, tmpo starts instantly and uses minimal resources
- **🎯 Automatic Project Detection** - Detects project names from Git repos or `.tmporc` configuration files
- **🌐 Global Projects** - Track time for any project from any directory without configuration files
- **🎯 Milestone Tracking** - Organize time entries into sprints, releases, or project phases
- **💾 Local & Private Storage** - All data stored locally in SQLite - your time tracking stays private
- **📊 Rich Reporting** - View stats, export to CSV/JSON, and track hourly rates
- **⚡ Zero Configuration Needed** - Works out of the box, configure only when you need to

## Configuration

### Global Settings

Set your preferences for currency, date/time formats, and timezone:

```bash
tmpo config
```

This opens an interactive wizard to configure:

- Currency (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, and 30+ more)
- Date format (MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, or YYYY-MM-DD)
- Time format (24-hour or 12-hour)
- Timezone (IANA format like America/New_York)
- Export path (default directory for exported files)

### Per-Project Settings

**Local Projects (directory-specific):**

```bash
# Create a .tmporc file in your project directory
tmpo init

# Or skip prompts and use defaults
tmpo init --accept-defaults
```

**Global Projects (track from anywhere):**

```bash
# Create a global project you can use from any directory
tmpo init --global

# Now track time from anywhere
tmpo start --project "Project Name"
```

See the [Configuration Guide](docs/configuration.md) for details.
